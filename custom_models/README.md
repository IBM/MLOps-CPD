# Using custom models in your MLOps flow on CPD

We understand that you may have unique ML use cases that require custom-built models, which is why we don't only provide support for pre-built models like those found in the general demo provided in this repository. 

Fortunately, our great team working on the Watson Machine Learning Service have provided support for many more options such as `pytorch-onnx_1.10`, `tensorflow_2.7`and many more. For a detailed investigation of those, checkout [this folder](https://github.com/IBM/watson-machine-learning-samples/tree/master/cpd4.6/notebooks/python_sdk/deployments) in our [watson-machine-learning-samples](https://github.com/IBM/watson-machine-learning-samples/tree/master) repository.  

Within this folder (current repository) you will find some of those examples retrofitted to our demo asset.
